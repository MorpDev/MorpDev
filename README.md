Hi! My name is MorpDev also known as Vaporize. I am busy making web based games, game coding, website development, artificial system development and pixel art. I am also a pixel nft artist. I know many software and programming languages, but I am more interested in typescript, python, java, c and c++. I like to play games and read books. I use two computers, one for gaming and the other my personal computer. I am not very interested in social media, you can reach me on platforms such as discord and instagram. Apart from that, I like to watch adventure movies, at the same time, let me give you a secret information, the most important thing for me in games or platforms is graphics. First of all, I give importance to design and graphics, and I am also a UI / UX designer. That's all the information I can give about me. Good day to you all.

Hi! My name is MorpDev Vaporize also known as. I am busy making web-based games, game coding, website development, artificial system development and making pixel pictures. I am also a pixel nft artist. I know a lot of software and programming languages, but I'm mostly interested in typescript, python, java, c and c++. I like to play games and read books. I use two computers, one for playing games and one for my personal computer. I am not a person who is very interested in social media, you can find me on platforms such as discord and instagram. Apart from that, I like to watch adventure movies, at the same time, let me give you a secret information, the most important thing for me in games or platforms is graphics. First of all, I give importance to design and graphics, but I am not a designer. That's all the information I can give about me. Good day to all of you.
